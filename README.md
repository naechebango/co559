# Hospital Management System with Java Swing GUI and SQL Database
A2 - SQL Databases and Java Swing

This is a group assignment, where we were tasked to create a GUI using Java Swing to return, add and modify information in an SQL database remotely.
This being a group assignment, my role was for the functionality of the program. I was in charge of creating, connecting, retrieving and modifying information for the database. In most cases I had also created the frontend designs of the different GUI frames as well as creating the database tables withing the MySQL Workbench.

The different frames:

# Hospital Management System with Java Swing GUI and SQL Database

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Hospital Management System" GitHub repository! This project is the culmination of a collaborative effort to develop a comprehensive Java Swing GUI application integrated with an SQL database. Our primary objective was to create a robust system for managing information about doctors within a hospital and facilitating appointment bookings with patients.

## Project Overview
In this group assignment, we have harnessed the power of Java Swing to craft an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI serves as the frontend of our Hospital Management System, allowing users to seamlessly interact with the database. Our system supports functions such as retrieving, adding, and modifying data stored in a remote SQL database.

## Features
Our project boasts several key features:

1. **Doctor Information Management:** Our system enables administrators to easily manage doctor profiles, including their personal details, specialties, and availability.

2. **Patient Appointment Booking:** Patients can effortlessly schedule appointments with their preferred doctors through the GUI, ensuring efficient healthcare service.

3. **Database Connectivity:** We have established a robust connection to an SQL database, facilitating real-time data retrieval and modification. This connection ensures that all user interactions are seamlessly synchronized with the database.

4. **Frontend Design:** The frontend of our application is designed with user experience in mind. We have created intuitive and visually appealing GUI frames that enhance the overall usability of the system.

5. **Database Schema:** The database schema, designed using MySQL Workbench, is optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring the smooth operation of the system.
